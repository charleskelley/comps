Comps Decision Records
######################

Decision records capture all important architectural, design, and process
decisions relaing to Comps package development.

Decision records are semi-structured--providing a general outline for capturing
the key aspects across all decisions while also providing enough flexibility to
capture the unique context surrounding an individual decision.

See `CDR 000 - Comps Decision Record Template`_ for an example template
with general guidelines for creating a good decision record.

Loosely based on the `Markdown Any Decision Record`_.
