# Comparative and causal analyis 

The `comps` package makes general comparative analysis easy and supports
experimental design and observational analysis for causal inference. Along
these lines the package has two primary objectives.

1. Support general comparison across groups quickly in an opinionated manner.
   Ease of use and domain specfic formatting are prefered over customizability. 
2. Facilitate causal analysis by providing algorithms for matching and testing
   differences between groups.

The comps package helps one easily mimic sample groups drawn from a specific
population and find the closest individual matches within a population or
sample set. These two approaches, 1) matching or balancing groups and 2)
matching individual observations are frequently used in isolation and in tandem
for comparative observational studies and experimental design. It's extremely
helpful, therefore, to have a package that allows you to conveniently move
between the approaches or combine them in fluid manner.
