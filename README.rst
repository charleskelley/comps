Comparison & Causal Analysis
============================

The Comps package makes comparative analysis easy and supports
causal-comparitive experimental design or observational analysis used for
causal inference. Along these lines, the package has two primary objectives.

1. Support general comparison across groups quickly in an opinionated manner
   where ease of use and domain specific formatting are preferred over
   customizability
2. Facilitate causal analysis by providing algorithms for matching observations
   to create comparison groups and statistically quantifying incremental
   differences between those groups

The Comps package helps one easily balance attributes across sample groups
drawn from a specific population or find the closest individual matches from
one sample set within another population or sample set.

These two approaches, 1) matching or balancing groups and 2) matching
individual observations are frequently used in isolation or in tandem for
comparative analysis, observational studies, and experimental design.
Therefore, it's extremely helpful to have a package that allows you to
conveniently move between the approaches or combine them in fluid manner.

See the `Comps documentation <httx://www.example.com>`_ for complete details.
